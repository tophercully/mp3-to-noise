# NoiseToNoise - Audio to Noise-Data Generator and Manipulator

Record or upload some audio, and NoiseToNoise will chart the amplitude of the audio file at the sample rate you specify. Adjust the upper and lower thresholds (floor and ceiling) and the exponential curve to weight values around the midpoint.
